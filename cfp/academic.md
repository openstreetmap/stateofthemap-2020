<h2 id="intro">Academic Track</h2>

This year’s State of the Map conference will feature the third edition of the Academic Track - a full day of sessions dedicated to academic research about, and with, OpenStreetMap (for the outputs of last year’s Track, see [here](https://2019.stateofthemap.org/academic_programme/)). These sessions will showcase both the ongoing innovation and maturity of scientific investigations and research into OpenStreetMap. The Academic Track sessions will provide a bridge to connect members of the OpenStreetMap community and the academic community by providing an open passage for exchange of ideas, communication and opportunities for increased collaboration. We expect empirical, methodological, conceptual, or literature-review-based contributions addressing any scientific aspect related to OpenStreetMap (OSM), in particular, but not limited to, the following:

  * Extrinsic or intrinsic quality assessment of OpenStreetMap data
  * Analysis of contribution patterns in OpenStreetMap
Generation of new and scientifically valuable datasets from OpenStreetMap
  * Assessments of data import procedures and their impacts on data and community
  * Integration between OpenStreetMap and other data sources (authoritative or user-generated)
  * Analysis/comparison of available software for scientific purposes related to OpenStreetMap
  * New approaches to facilitate or improve data collection and/or data quality in OpenStreetMap (e.g. through gamification or citizen science approaches)
  * Open research problems in OpenStreetMap and challenges for the scientific community
  * Cultural, political, and organizational aspects of data production and usage practices in OpenStreetMap
  * Using OpenStreetMap data in applied science
OpenStreetMap use and research in Africa
  * Reviews of any scientific aspect connected to OpenStreetMap

In an effort to improve the interaction and collaboration between the academic and the more general OpenStreetMap communities, authors are invited to particularly highlight the practical implications or impacts of their research on the OpenStreetMap community at large.

<h2 id="guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>

Authors are invited to submit abstracts using the State of the Map 2020 Pretalx [submission system](https://pretalx.com/state-of-the-map-2020-academic-track/cfp). Deadline for submission is 9 March 2020.

Abstracts should include from a minimum of 500 to a maximum of 800 words.These limits will be strictly enforced for a fair and balanced review process.

Abstracts must be scientifically rigorous and the content should be structured as follows: introduction/background, where the problem addressed is introduced; main aim or purpose of the study; brief description of the methodology and findings achieved; final discussion highlighting the scientific contribution of the study and its practical benefits/implications.
There are no specific formatting or layout guidelines as the abstract will be submitted online in plain-text format.

Abstracts will be evaluated by the scientific committee. Authors of selected abstracts will be invited to give an oral presentation during the Academic Track sessions at the conference or to present a poster as part of the conference’s poster session. Building on top of the successful [Proceedings of the Academic Track at State of the Map 2019](https://zenodo.org/record/3405431#.XiXKJ3VKgQ8), selected abstracts will be published as a collection, each with a distinct Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), an open access online repository.

The 2019 Academic Track resulted in a special issue of the [ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi) that is now being [organized](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issues/OpenStreetMap). Similarly, the scientific committee will seek to further disseminate the contributions to this conference by organizing a special issue in a relevant, open access, scientific journal. Authors of the selected abstracts will be invited to submit a full paper to this special issue. Successful submissions may enjoy partial or full waiver of publication fees.
