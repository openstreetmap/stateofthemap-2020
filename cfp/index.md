<h2 id="call">Call for Participation</h2>

The State of the Map conference is the annual OpenStreetMap conference run by
the OpenStreetMap Foundation. It is organised by the SotM Working Group, a team
of volunteers. This year our host venue is the University of Cape Town (UCT).

State of the Map is intended as an opportunity for the OpenStreetMap community
to get to know each other, both personally and regarding their work in
OpenStreetMap. People who visit the conference take home lots of new ideas for
their own OpenStreetMap projects. We want to offer a widespread OpenStreetMap
related program that covers all topics relevant to OpenStreetMap. Sharing
OpenStreetMap knowledge is the essence of SotM. Apart from the presentations
themselves, it is an important aspect of the conference that listeners can
interact with the speaker for questions and discussion. We want to offer an
atmosphere that boosts vivid discussions, including about controversial topics.
We try to solicit contributions from all topics of the OpenStreetMap ecosystem.

We would love to see your submission for one or more of these tracks:

* OSM Basics
* Community and Foundation
* Mapping
* Cartography
* Software Development
* Data Analysis & Data Model
* User Experiences
* Art & Creativity

<h2 id="tracks">Tracks</h2>

Don't worry too much about the track categories; they help us organise the
conference, but if you find it difficult to select the right track for your
talk, just choose the one that fits best and we will make adjustments if
necessary.

<h3 id="track-basics" class="trackicon">OSM Basics</h3>

OSM  has grown a lot. Many newcomers have a great thirst for knowledge in areas
that may seen uninteresting and basic to others. We reserve a  number of slots
for talks that help to satisfy this need. It is  important that you have real
expertise in the subject you want to talk  about and have the ability to make it
comprehensible.  Please note in the submission what approximate level of
previous knowledge is required.

Examples for this kind of talk are: Explaining the OSM data model. Education in
OSM Editors or cartography tools. Becoming a working group member. Please do not
submit talks that require the audience to buy software or service subscriptions,
create an account on a business platform, or a platform with user tracking.

<h3 id="track-community" class="trackicon">Community and Foundation</h3> Do you
want to recount your experiences while community building? Or do you want to
talk about the vision of OSMF? Or discuss the strategy of the Board? Also
reflecting diversity of community or questions of etiquette are suitable for
this track. Other topics could be „why  become an OSMF member“, working group
experiences, …

<h3 id="track-mapping" class="trackicon">Mapping</h3> All about mapping,
surveying, data collection, and tagging. Tips and reflections on OSM editors, or
new editor features. Reflections on automated mapping, organised editing and
imports.

<h3 id="track-cartography" class="trackicon">Cartography</h3> Cartography and
data visualisation, rendering raster and vector maps, map styles, CartoCSS,
usage of Kosmtik, maps with QGIS, printing maps and more. All your ideas on how
to create a map.

<h3 id="track-software" class="trackicon">Software Development</h3> This track
awaits talks by or for developers of applications that make use of OSM data,
e.g. OSM editors, (vector) tile servers, geocoding, routing, navigation. Tips
and tricks with new PostGIS features, or new features of other tools and
applications.

<h3 id="track-data" class="trackicon">Data Analysis and Data Model</h3> This
track is dedicated to OSM data itself. Analysis of OSM data quality. Reflections
about enhancing the data model, or discussing the way the OSM data is accessed
through the API. Also submissions about deep lerning are welcome in this track.

<h3 id="track-experiences" class="trackicon">User Experiences</h3> This track is
all about the usage of OSM. Examples are usage in administration and government, public transport or as an education tool in class rooms. You can present citizen projects that are using OSM data to understand and manage their environment. This track also includes the humanitarian and scientific context as
well.

<h3 id="track-art" class="trackicon">Art & Creativity</h3> 
This track provides a space to present your artistic and creative projects that
use OpenStreetMap data or the OpenStreetMap theme to eg. create clothing,
jewellery, 3D printed objects, engravings, visualizations, computer or mobile
games, virtual worlds, augmented reality, flyers, postcards, etc.

<h2 id="submission">Submission Types</h2> We provide the following submission
types:

<h3 id="submission-talk">Talk (20 minutes)</h3> Classic talk with 20 minutes for
the talk itself and 5 minutes for questions. This is the preferred submission
type.

<h3 id="submission-workshop">Workshop (60–90 minutes)</h3> We appreciate the
submission of workshops, especially since visitors of previous years' SotMs
often told us that they would apreciate the possibility to attend more workshops
about about basic OSM topics as well as about innovative technologies. Basic
mapping workshops could even happen outdoors. Further topics could be basic OSM
editing workshops using JOSM or ID. How to render a map? How to print a map?

We are reserving the term "workshop" for sessions in which the audience is
actively involved, for example by following some steps on their own devices. If
you are however planning to submit a longer presentation which doesn't involve
hands-on experience, then please use the "extended talk" submission type (see
below). Please communicate any requirements an attendee should fulfil in order
to attend your proposed workshop regarding technical equipment. Please ensure
that your visitors shouldn't be told to create an account at a business platform
or a platform with user tracking. Or if so communicate that in an exposed way in
your submission and provide guest accounts for your vistors.

<h3 id="submission-extended_talk">Extended Talk (40 minutes)</h3> An extended
talk with 40 minutes for the talk and 15 minutes for questions. In past years we
provided such extended talks under the label workshop, which didn‘t fit so well.
You should outline why your talk deserves more time.

<h3 id="submission-panel">Panels (60-90 minutes)</h3> 
Panels are for hot, controversial discussions around OSM community, mapping and
data. Topics may cover for example diversity, legal questions or the future of
the database. You should outline the format how you intend to organise the
discussion and make sure to invite the key players for the discussion. Panels
may or may not include the audience. Do what works best for your topic.

<h3 id="submission-bof">Birds of a Feather</h3> [Birds of a
Feather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)) sessions are
informal, spontaneous discussion rounds centered around a specific topic. It is
*not possible* to submit a BoF session in advance. Instead, we will provide a
wiki page to organize it shortly before the conference. We plan to provide a lot
of space for BoF sessions as this was massively appreciated in past SotMs.

<h3 id="submission-other">Other</h3> Your submission does not fit into any of
these submission types? Please get in touch with the program committee via email
before the end of the call for participation.

<h2 id="rating">Rating Criteria</h2> In rating submissions, we will apply the
following criteria:

* OSM as the subject: A submission where OSM is the main subject or an important
  ingredient will be rated higher than one that is more generic (e.g. a general
talk about GIS software).
* Preference of „open“: A submission about open data and open source software
  will be preferred over one that deals with proprietary data or proprietary
software and closed platforms.
* Preference of innovation: A submission about something new, or something not
  discussed at previous conferences, will be preferred over one that discusses
more widely known issues (exception: OSM Basics).
* We are hoping for talks from a multitude of speakers and hence we would prefer
  accepting a talk from a „new“ speaker over accepting a second talk from
someone who has already an accepted talk.
* We will also try to avoid accepting many talks from members of the same
  organisation.
* We prefer talks from members of underrepresented groups.
* We value transparency. We prefer submissions that disclose affiliations and
  sponsors of their work.

Sometimes we will make some changes or have suggestions:

* We might ask if several speakers can merge their talks.
* We might also ask if a change of format would be possible (for example we
  might suggest the lightning talk format instead of talk when we find it is not
enough content for a complete talk, but an interesting subject)

<h2 id="language">Language</h2> The conference language of State of the Map is
English. All presentations shall be held in English. It is an important aspect
of the conference that visitors can interact with the speaker for questions and
discussion.

Non-English visitors are welcome to meet in Bird of Feather sessions (BoF). We
will provide a wiki page for organizing BoF sessions in languages other than
English with English translation.

<h2 id="publication">Publication</h2> Video recordings and slides of the
lectures will be published under the Creative Commons Attribution International
3.0 or later (CC BY 3.0+) license. If you do not wish your lectures to be
published or streamed, please let us know in your submission.

<h2 id="travel_costs_visa">Travel Costs and Visa</h2> State of the Map is a
non-commercial event where neither the organisers nor the speakers are being
paid. Speakers have to buy a conference ticket just like everyone else. If
necessary, we are able to provide limited support for travel costs.
 
If you need help applying for a visa, e.g. an official invitation to present to
the South African embassy, we can provide that. Please be aware that the visa
application procedure may take several weeks or even months.

<h2 id="committee">Program Committee</h2> Your submissions will be reviewed by a
program committee consisting of OpenStreetMap community members from various
parts of the world.

 * Christine Karch (chairwoman SotM Working Group, Germany)
 * Arun Ganesh (mapper and carthographer, India)
 * Benoît Fournier (mapper, France)
 * Bernelle Verster (local team)
 * Gregory Marler (SotM Working Group, United Kingdom)
 * Ilya Zverev (forum moderator, Russia)
 * Jennings Anderson (researcher, United States)
 * Manfred Stock (mapper, Switzerland)
 * Mats’eliso Thobei (mapper, Lesotho and Ireland)
 * Miriam Gonzales (Geochicas, Mexico)
 * Sarah Hoffmann (developer, Germany)
 * Satochi Iida (OSMF Japan, Japan)
 * Sidorela Uku (mapper, Albania)
 * Séverin Menard (EOF, France, French-speaking West-African and Caribbean
   outreach)

The program committee is aware of possible *conflict of interest* situations. We
try to balance that by having a well balanced composition of the committee.
Nevertheless, we have imposed some rules upon ourselves to handle conflict of
interest situations:

* We do not rate submissions from our workmates, clients or relatives.
* We act carefully and are aware about possible conflicts (especially the
  situation of horse trading). We act particularly carefully in cases we are
related to a sponsor.
* We communicate to other PC members when we are in a conflict of interest
  situation.
* We report any outside attempt of influencing their decisions to the chair of
  the SotM Working Group.

We hope this detailed "Call for Presentations" helps to increase the
transparency of our program selection process. Questions are welcome. You can
reach us at the following email address:
[program-sotm@openstreetmap.org](mailto:program-sotm@openstreetmap.org). For
questions about visa applications please write to
