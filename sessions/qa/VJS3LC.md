Add questions here Please feel free to start writing questions before
the end of the talk :)


-   Is it a new tool ?
    -   I discover it this morning but found a lot of issues (some are
        already described)
-   We would use it or a whole region or country (i.e. France)
    -   but Mapcampaigner don't accept large areas üò¢
-   Do you plan to display % also by attributes ? please elaborate more
    the question
    -   I want to know of many i.e. names are set for all the OSM
        objects in the campaign ?
    -   same thing for another attribute
    -   (currently you display the completeness for all attributes)
-   What is the frequency of overpass queries
-   Is HOT using Map Campaigner currently? Or did you create it mostly
    for other users?
-   What is the link to the project you were demonstrating?
