1.   \[ANSWERED\] How do you determine if a building or a highway is a
    contribution by HOT Tasking manager? Are there tags at the data like
    in the changeset comments like \#missingmaps or \#hotosm? Maybe you
    said that and I missed this part of information -- Susanne SB
2.  \[ANSWERED\] How did you count mapping vs validation activities?
    number of users? features? edits? -- Serena. Thanks, I agree a tasks
    is a suitable unit of comparison.
3.  \[ANSWERED\] The OSHDB framework was created in order to facilitate
    performing OSM history-based analysis by non-developers, e.g.
    researchers. Do you have an estimation of how many people are
    currently using it? -- Marco Minghini
4.  \[ANSWERED\] Has your study show any impact on OSM mapping during
    the current pandemic? -- Serena
    1.  this blog post shows a record in mappign on OSM, and TM projects
        are related

5.  \[ANSWERED\] Are you aware of studies (or have possibly conducted
    one yourself) investigating possible differences regarding mapping
    behaviours between humanitarian mappers and 'ordinary' mappers also
    beyond specific actions/tasks? Are HOT mappers mapping different
    kinds of features in possibly different ways? -- René
6.  \[ANSWERED\] Sort of implied by the numbers/graphs, but not exactly
    formulated as such. But would you conclude that initiatives like
    HOT/Missing Maps are successful drivers for mapping participation?
    -- YaguraStation
7.  \[ANSWERED\] Was this study asked by HOT? if no, did you get their
    feedback? -- Marco Minghini
8.  \[ANSWERED\] Have you included several Tasking Managers used for
    humanitarian purposes (like HOT TM Indonesia or Tasking Manager of
    Les Geographes Libres (francophone movement), or is it only an
    analysis of one TaskingManager, the principle HOT Tasking Manager?

-    I like the diagram that puts humanitarian mapping activities in
    context - nice overview -- Serena
