Trademark and OSMF issues

1.  You mentioned the need for a license for "www.OSMmirror.com" - to
    give a well-known example, does this apply to OSMand, and if so,
    what is the current situation? - Richard F
    1.  Thank you very much!
2.  What about visual markers (logos)?
3.  Do you mean derivatives or real logos?
    1.  The real logo.
        1.  In particular, don't confuse visually appealing
            attributions.
