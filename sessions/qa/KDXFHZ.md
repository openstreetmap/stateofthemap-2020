1.  Thanks for your talk, do you create some specific JOSM validator
    rules? or you used the  standard one? I used the standard one in
    JOSM
2.  Today I learned that there's specific tags for highways in Africa!
    just wanted to ask about data validation, how long does it take for
    a mapper to become a validator? Does it take 1 month? Or maybe less?
    I guess it depends on how much time they spend on mapping, is it
    daily, is it every once a week or is it every once in a while
    1.  yes, thank you! 1 month is not enough got it
3.  Do you find some difference between the standard tag for highway in
    Africa and the one in Liberia? No, it's more or less just the same
    as Africa standard tag on OSM Wiki
4.  What proportion of Liberia do these 4 counties represent? Are there
    plans to expand this approach to the rest of the country? If yes -
    what are the resources needed for that and are they available? If
    not - is it still valuable to do this exercise for a small fraction
    of the country? Thank youLiberia has 15 counties, so it's more or
    less 1/3 of the country has been mapped on OSM and since the Liberia
    Household Social Registry (LHSR) is done gradually and is projected
    to cover the entire country in a 2-year period, there's a
    probability for a similar project in the future


Thank you for the presentation Tri
