Q preguntas :

1.  \[DONE\] Routing for hikers - Is there dedicated router for hikers
    in Italy, or elsewhere? Are there recommended tags to help hiking
    routing compared to normal routing -- chippy?
2.  \[DONE\] Does relation type=route are ~periodically broken?
    1.  how do you detect broken routes?
3.  \[DONE\] Isn't it dangerous for hikers when there are hiking paths
    that are incomplete or wrong or even not updated in specific areas?
    How do you deal with this?
4.  \[DONE\] Maybe it was already said during the talk, do you have any
    idea how many mappers are mapping for this project?
5.  Are you using GPS with RTK to better map path in moutains?
    1.  Path are difficult to map in forests and GPS isn't very accurate
        ;)

6\. \[DONE\] Are other hiking clubs in Italy interested in this great
work? --chippy
