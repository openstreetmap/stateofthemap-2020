1.  You have sent postcards to mappers, but have you ever got one
    yourself? - Gregory
2.  Sending postcards too far can be costly, will there be a future
    feature to only get addresses in your country/region? - Gregory
    1.  There could be postcard printing services distributed all over
        the world which will print on demand and from remote senders
        (for Swiss residents there's e.g. PostCard Creator App)? --
        Stefan
3.  You talked about sending postcards because not everyone can afford
    to travel to SotM. Have you encouraged any of those people to apply
    for a SotM scholarship? - Gregory. (I will end my questions now, but
    thank you Ilya for your passion and the human connection shown in
    this).


Notes:

1.  Note many rural people's mailboxes, if any, are far from their
    houses, so any **<span class="underline">postcards</span>** will
    get 1. stolen, 2. soaked with rain, etc. before people might get
    them. That is (one reason) why many people are reluctant to give out
    their legal address. Furthermore, if a mail arrives, it will cause
    the whole village to make a big effort to finally get the mail to
    the person, causing big embarrassment. Also headaches for the
    postman who doesn't know how to get the mail to the person. (And...
    postcards might spread virus?!)
2.  On changesets: It's not easy to comment on changeset from people I
    know personal. How much harder is it to address new people... +1
3.  Yes, I'm constantly worried: I thought I mapped that already. Did
    someone delete it? (Yes there are tools to check.)
4.  For postcard to black\_bike: Harald Schwarz, Germany, 40880
    Ratingen, Weimarer Straße 1      :-)
5.  Just in registering progress at osmcards.org  !!! Done. Waiting for
    cards. And addresses.
6.  Privacy
    1.  +1 one answering that already -Enock


Comments

1.  Lovely presentation -Enock +1
2.  Problem of  OSM: Our community lacks club culture of sports clubs or
    choirs that meet on a regular personal base to train and have fun
    each week together.
3.  And mother will see the postcard: Johnny: I told you not to play
    that "OSM video game" with your friends any more, and get back to
    your school books. Slap! (Privacy issue. She will open an envelope
    too.)
4.  Drinking beer together calms many angry conflicts, lets see if
    postcards work.
5.  Sorry but your postcards aren't helping global warming.
    1.  Warming hearts counts more than minimal climate effect of some
        postcards.
        1.  If the sea rises, then there are less places on land that we
            have to map. :(
            1.  Coast lines are comlex to handle, so even more global
                warming,---
        2.  How about an old fasioned email instead. They can even print
            it out on a printer if they want.
    2.  I think the key thing is that this is optional. If you want to
        minimise postcards being sent, then don't sign up. - Gregory.
    3.  Some people do not travel to SotM if it means they have to fly,
        this is a lower-impact way for them to still feel connected to
        the conference. Not everyone will get that feeling or care for
        postcards, but that's okay.
6.  I think this actually could also involve OSM - when the design of
    the postcard is an OSM based map! So: Did you think about a
    **postcard printing service** at least to save it as PDF
    (<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_on_Paper)?> (Stefan
    Keller)
7.  Can you explain again on how to use this part of www.osmcards.org?
    "Use this URL for sharing your profile": ....    
    <https://www.osmcards.org/profile/>...
8.  Integrate this as predefined in the OSM Wiki, OSM.org user name?
    1.  I don't know if Ilya knew how that would be used, you could link
        to it from your profile page or you could share it by private
        message if you want.
    2.  See an example here: <https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Zverik>
        :) -- Ilya
