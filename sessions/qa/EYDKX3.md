**Questions**

1.  \[ANSWERED\] Can you comment on informal settlements detected in
    South Africa? asseblief \[please\] ;-) -- Serena. Thanks, we are
    mapping away, but it may take some time...
    1.  (comment:
        [https://www.openstreetmap.org/\#map=17/-34.06021/18.66231,https://millionneighborhoods.org/\#17/-34.06021/18.66231](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/-34.06021/18.66231,https://millionneighborhoods.org/#17/-34.06021/18.66231)Â

2.  \[ANSWERED\] Maybe off-topic, regarding above example in 1.
    (Monwabisi Park): City planning-wise how would their situation be
    improved(eg. in regard to accessibility)?
3.  \[ANSWERED\] You discussed reblocking, and in your paper you show
    how "We observe that new infrastructure segments typically appear as
    dead-end streets (culs-de-sac), as the minimal edge set needed to
    connect a collection of nodes will always yield a tree graph." But a
    street network of dead-end streets is notoriously harmful to
    walkability (as in USA suburbs), and will result in residents having
    to take long network-distance walks when the absolute distance of
    their trip is short. How can you help ensure this will not be used
    to design neighborhoods that are difficult to walk in? Thanks for
    your fascinating talk! -Taylor, ITDP (thanks for reading the long
    question!)
    1.  Marco: you are welcome, thanks for the interest!
4.  \[ANSWERED\] Is it possible to assess/compare the quality of the
    settlements with the OSM boundaries?
5.  \[ANSWERED\] What are the software tools you used to perform the
    work/run the model? Is the source code available? -- Marco Minghini


**Comments**

1.  \[ANSWERED\] If those "cadastral maps" ever leaked to the commumity
    they would go nuts: "Hey that's my land. You gave it to neighbor C",
    etc.-jidanni
    1.  Even real cadastral maps are sensitive. (usually due to not
        being aligned precicsly... even that is source of endless
        arguments.)-jidanni
    2.  Even slightly out of date real cadastral maps are destroyed by
        govenments, to avoid misunderstandings.
    3.  No matter if there is big warning "not a real cadastral map"...
        people will take it as the real thing.-jidanni
2.  Yes I wanted to do a historical cadastral map project... only to
    find even the parcel numbers had been erased by the Taiwan
    government due to "sensitivity". (Could only query one by one.)
3.  All the buildings I trace from imagery are squwed several random
    meters thanks to Bing, etc. I hope you have better grasp of real
    WGS84 locations.-jidanni
