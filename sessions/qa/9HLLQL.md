**Questions**

1.  \[Done\] Cameron Green - how would your results differ when compared
    to other well mapped areas in Africa such as Tanzania?
2.  \[Done\] Which technique do you think is moust useful to help in the
    instrinsic studies - the K-Means or the other: PCA? Guy
3.  \[DONE\] Was there a effort to plot cluster-member mapping against
    automated error finding such as Keepright or Osmose? i.e. to find
    errors in mapping tied to specific clusters? (Great job!)

4.  \[DONE\] Did you try out other clustering methods aside from
    K-means? Can you explain more about your reasoning for using a
    parametric-based clustering method over a density-based clustering
    method? - ardieorden
    1.  got it, thanks!
5.  \[Done\] Will you be continuing with this study, or is the project
    now complete?
6.  \[DONE\] Spatial data quality has 5 elements according to
    <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-195-x/2011001/other-autre/qua-eng.htm>
    . On what data quality element are you after: Completeness?
    Accurracy? other? ~Stefan K.



**Comments**

-   \[DONE\] Wow, awesome work -- YaguraStation
-   \[DONE\] Really interesting analysis based upon the clustering of
    users. It reflects other studies I have seen from other studies with
    key contributors adding much data. Guy
