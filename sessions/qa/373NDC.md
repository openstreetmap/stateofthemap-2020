**Questions:**

1.  \[DONE\] GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) standard demand
    bus stop, do you work with this standard? How manage this
    requirement?
    1.  ANSWER: Yes, we are working with GTFS data. For informal bus
        routes we build virtual bus stops on every crossing - Sören
        (Trufi)
    2.  Are you planning to support GTFS-Flex?, Felix
        1.  Yes, definitely. Actually, we are running Trufi App in Addis
            Ababa already with GTFS Flex and want to migrate the other
            cities as well.
2.  \[DONE\] How do you create bus routes ?
    1.  if I understood well, you create GTFS from OSM routes ?
    2.  Do you create routes manually with JOSM ??
3.  \[DONE\] What are "Digital Principles"? (The speaker mentioned that
    the app was developed "along Digital Princples, if you know what I
    mean".) -- das-g
    1.  you can see <https://digitalprinciples.org/>
        1.  (thanks!) -- das-g
4.  \[DONE\] Which countries in Africa are using it?
    1.   (Ghana and Ethiopia)
5.  \[DONE\] Anyone in Tanzania?
    1.  Not yet, please contact us! - Christoph
6.  \[DONE\] What level of technical expertise do you need?
    1.  ANSWER: The tech team must be able to develop in Dart/Flutter or
        able to learn it - Sören (Trufi)
7.  \[DONE\] It was mentioned that the app is customized / localized for
    local communities. When travelling several Trufi-enabled places
    (cities, countries), do I have to download a separate app for each,
    or is there one I could use everywhere? -- das-g
8.  \[DONE\] Will the app(s) be available of F-Droid?
    <https://f-droid.org/> -- das-g
    1.  Yes, please contact me if you want to help us to publish it on
        F-Droid!
    2.  We made a try but failed and haven't tried again. - Christoph
9.  \[DONE\] Why are there multiple apps (forks of the original) instead
    of one (localized) brand?
10. How do you deal with the very chaotic and different ways to map
    public transport in OSM? If you have your own model: Is it available
    in the OSM-wiki or elsewhere?
    1.  We have a guideline on how we do it:
        <https://www.trufi-association.org/projects/the-ultimate-guide/>
    2.  Sören will talk about this in his talk at 20:00 UTC - Christoph
11. How can you collaborate with companies likke WhereIsMyTransport from
    South Africa to target the coverage for more cities?
    1.  Our data is Open Data from OSM and WhereIsMyTransport isn't
        -Enock
    2.  We could collaborate with companies like WhereIsMyTransport,
        because our App could be an add-on to their backend - of course,
        we would prefer an open source backend. - Christoph
12. \[DONE\] What does the name "trufi" mean / derive from? -- das-g
    1.  Taxi de Ruta Fija :)
    2.  From Bolivia - Enock, Meaning??
13.  \[DONE\] Are there issues with internet connectivity in some places
    that the busses go? - Gregory +1
    1.  Yes - unfortunately, our app requires right now internet for the
        search with OpenTripPlanner Server. - Christoph
14. How is market penetration of the drivers app?
    1.  Not yet - we look for a funding to finalize it. - Christoph
15. Will the app help the drivers to find their way?  --- Sometimes the
    driver in the villages does not know the exact route.
    1.  What do you mean with "find their way"?
        1.  Yes, but most important share GPS coordinates so that users
            know, when the next bus comes.
16. Can I see the vehicles in realtime? Like uber vehicle?
    1.  In the future :) - Enock
        1.  Yes, with the driver app. - Christoph
17. Are the informations only useable on a smartphone or on a normal PC
    as well?
    1.  Only smartphone right now. - Christoph
18. This app is compatible with the relations of transport created in
    openstreetmap?
    <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:public_transport>
    1.  Yes! Using osm2gtfs you have a ready GTFS for OTP - Enock
        1.  Exactly - that's what we build on. OSM2GTFS is a good option
            and our own tool, published on Github.
19. Do you think managing (mapping and keeping it updated) bus routes in
    OSM is sustainable? - wille
    1.  Yes, I think it is sustainable - Wille, could you write me, why
        not? - Christoph
        1.  In some places routes change too much. It's difficult to map
            with relations in OSM, it costs time to be reviewing all
            changes and assure information is reliable. Maybe it's a
            good solution if you don't have official data.
            1.  Yes, that's a challenge. Therefore, we need a lot of
                community efforts. Sören will show later how to do the
                work with JOSM.
            2.  Users can also say, when routes are wrong or missing and
                track their journey. With many of these trackings, we
                want to establish a process to get curated routes to OSM
                to keep it up2date.
            3.  BTW, we only work in places without official data. -
                Christoph
20. In bad shape here in central Taiwan
    1.  Let's clean it up together :) - Christoph
21. in big cities) Don't bus companies give GTFS files to Google? Well
    ask them for an extra copy.
    1.  Yes, cities with digitizes public transport often already have
        GTFS. That is of course the easy start for Trufi :)
    2.  By the way, TRUFI can help maintaining the GTFS accurate and
        up-to-date, with the user feedback on missing or outdated
        routes. - Christoph
