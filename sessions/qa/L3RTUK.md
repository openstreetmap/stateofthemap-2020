**Questions:**


1.  \[DONE\] Do the things you map(like safe spaces) change, how
    frequently do you have to check the mapping? - Gregory
2.  \[DONE\] Are these maps secret somehow as these open maps can lead
    to vulnerability issues, can't authoroties use them to track down
    the community members?- Trudy
    1.  -redacted spaces and adjustments are done for safety of
        participants - heather  (Mikko's comment)
3.  \[DONE\] How have you collaborated during the Covid times? What has
    been the impact? What recommends would you have for other LGBTQI
    communities around the world, including safe spaces?- Heather
    1.  \- the map during covid had 20,000 views during covid times - to
        help people (Mikko's comment) - heather - fantastic work!!
4.  \[DONE\] What are some ways that the map connect this community?
    -heather
    1.  \[Mikko\] There are hundreds of LGBT organizations in the
        country but they are not connected thus through mapping these
        spaces we are able to show force/power/existence to other
        people. Amazingly we (LGBT community) were able to see that even
        in far-flung areas there are LGBT groups that emerge.
    2.  We T (of LGBT, Type: "CD") are so few, that we need a map of
        where we all live. So we can find each other! (Alas, as any
        precise mapping is quite personal...). (Sure, there are
        apps...) - I do not suggest that we map per individual house of
        the location of our sisters and brothers but it is an empowering
        way already that we. can map the location of support
        organizations. Ideally, we eventually find. ourselves among the
        crowd. We need to stand out as a collective so that we can also
        be there for others. Be a beacon and a sanctuary for others
        &lt;3 \[MapBeks\] I can help set things up for you but make sure
        that the safety is always considered.
    3.  \[Mikko\] Focus on organizations that provide services for
        LGBTQI  -  we are still collating data and validating locations
        of health services such HIV facilities and clinics that support
        our transbrothers and sisters
