**Resources:**


-   some research on diversity
    -    <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Diversity>
-   also see the Diversity and Inclusion working group
    -   <https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Diversity_and_Inclusion_Special_Committee>


**Questions**


1.  \[DONE\] How can you measure the men and (How do you know if osm
    contributors are men or women?)
    1.  How do you identify the sex of mappers in your analysis when  we
        tend to use either nicknames or gender neutral short names. For
        example Chris,  is that Christopher or Christine. Gender neutral
        names are commonly used normal life outside of OSM
2.  \[DONE\] What is the percentage of paid mappers in terms of
    contribution and what is their rentention once project is done? -
    Trudy
3.  How can we use the research to for community retention?
4.  So is the imbalance "bad and there should be a effort to correct
    it", or, "accept it, their brains are different"?
5.  How can we better measure non-technolgy contributions to OSM? -
    heather
6.  \[DONE\] Do you think there is a danger that mappers avoid telling
    their gender (or setting a name that identifies their gender)
    because there are thoughts that men and women map differently? --
    Gregory
7.  \[DONE\] Are there more differences between individual men and
    between individual women than an average man and an average woman?
8.  Do you first see the edit types and then go ahead to ping the users
    to certify if the gender you identified is correct?
9.  \[DONE\] Was there any difference in men and women's access to
    technology and training?
    1.  this was not formally asked in the survey
10. \[DONE\] What are your suggestion for increasing the contribution of
    woman in mapping activity? Would it be make the mapathon specific to
    their needs? Or maybe make the tags/presets to specific to women?
    1.  Or make mapping features particularly relevant to women/and
        clearly demonstrate the impact of mapping?
11. \[DONE\] How do you compute smoothness? It is something qualitative
    or some metrics?
12. Which part the world your research covers? All the world or only
    some country?
13. Since you're indonesian, maybe is that correct why you only split
    gender into two categories ?  In my understanding Indonesia
    recognizes 5. some of researchers using common surveys. not sure if
    she consider that one.

15\. \[DONE\] Is this research being published any where?

**Comments**


-   this reminds me of the study presented at SOTM in Brussels a few
    years ago. we do need to see how we can do more data analysis and
    connect it to community development/engagement, technology,  and /or
    policy shifts/ - heather
-   Love the work that has been put in to add subtitles to the talk too
    :) - Jinal
-   Surely there are many **<span class="underline">transgender</span>**
    mappers here on OSM too.
    -   Yes they will be categorized into either male or female when
        making statistics.
        -   OK, so we need a separate study.
        -   So this study should differentiate *cisgender* vs.
            *transgender.*..
        -   they are those who aren't yet sure of their gender+1 - Trudy
-   It is difficult to identify the sex of most mappers as we tend to
    use either nicknames or gender neutral short names. For example
    Chris,  is that Christopher or Christine
-   <s>From previous talk we know many must be paid mappers...</s>
-   OSM should introduce gender on their signup. form - first step to
    diversity +1 - Trudy
    -   Better be more than two...
    -   and a prefer not to say option
-   If anyone is interested in helping Crowd2map do more research into
    this.  A previous survey is here
    <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=crowd2map%20suvey>  (we
    have more recent data to analyse)
-   The Google form you mentioned sounds so old fashioned with only
    \[x\]male, and \[x\]female, two boxes.
    -   There was an option to self identify or not say, but no one
        selected it
-   You should put this topic on your future study. Maybe you wanna do a
    further study like master or doctoral degree. OSM has evolved
    nowadays, becomes more and more detailed and profound
