-   Has your t-shirt arrived on time? :)
    -   which t-shirt?
-   What are you most excited about now that Mapillary is part of
    Facebook?
-   Are there any downsides to being part of Facebook?
-   The community is "afraid" that Mapillary is now part of Facebook :(
-   It is possible to increase the position of the photos using the
    elements present in the photos? In the sense of creating a
    photogrammetric approach with the 360 images to create a point
    cloud.
-   One should mention a problem when armchair mappers use photos
    without having own knowledge of the place.  You can demotivate local
    mappers and drive them away from OSM if the armchair mappers use
    outdated photos.
    -   what is the question here?
    -   or just a comment?
    -   why he does not mention this?
    -   it's remote mapping not armchair..
-   Can we remove our photos now so Facebook can't have them
    -   Facebook could use them before they acquired Mapillary; you
        granted an open licence
    -   this would be a silly thing to do, as you granted an *open*
        licence
-   Are there any plans to include point clouds (i.e. Lidar data)?
-   Is there any plan to snap photos to highways (semi)-automatically ?
-   Are the computer vision models you used open-source? Would love to
    try it out.
-   What are the most comfortable/effective 360 camera setups for hiking
    (capturing imagery on trails/paths)?
-   How do we invite Mapillary mappers to a country?  I'm thinking of
    Panamá, where the covering is really poor.
-   Could you provide help to stitch pictures from DIY 360° camera ?
