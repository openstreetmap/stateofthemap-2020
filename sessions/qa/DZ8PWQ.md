Add questions here:

1.  (Due to technical issues with my hardware I am filing this even
    before I attended the session) What happens when oral or local
    tradition differs from a national naming convention or even
    databases or when different languages collide in spelling or even
    the whole name? For example, we know from India, that spelling of
    geographic names differs between Hindi und Bengali, which is
    resolved by the India Geographical Survey by standardizing
    geographic names only in English language. And, does the collecting
    of names by mobile on the field lead into a later process of finding
    standard names in official GIS systems? Thank you, Matthias (German
    Wikipedia user Matthiasb).
2.  Very useful project, Janet and well done! What do you think are the
    importance of the map to the community? Is it about using it to
    lobby for development or for visibiliity to the world and for
    potential investments in the area? It seems to me that, in terms of
    map usage, the villagers probably know where everything is located
    but perhaps not outsiders. Thanks for showing the video showing
    reasons why they need maps! Great work! My questions are answered by
    the video and many thanks!
3.  What an incredible project!! Amazing work and thank you for sharing
    :) Especially love the emphasis on the lives of girls and that you
    are highlighting the challenges of equipment and access to wifi even
    in the local universities. Already on your website and looking
    forward to learning more about and from your project. Anni (Mansueto
    Institute at the University of Chicago)
4.  Very inspirational! Does your group use Tasking Manager for setting
    up mapping tasks and projects?

5.  Do you welcome remote mappers from other areas to help with your
    projects? -Greg\_Rose
    1.  Yes, absolutely!
