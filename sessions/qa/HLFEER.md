1.  You know about <https://equalstreetnames.brussels/> and
    <https://naziviulica.openstreetmap.rs/> ? \[by black\_bike\]
2.  Can data from a private API really be open? +1
    1.  Can it legally be open-sourced? -- Raphael (das-g)
3.  Are there streets named after persons, but without the given name in
    the street name (e.g. just the family name)? -- Raphael (das-g)
4.  How are streets split into multiple ways counted?
    1.  It seems not number of streets but street lengths were counted,
        so the splitting shouldn't matter. -- das-g
    2.  As OpenStreetMap lacks the concept of "street" counting them is
        the hard part.
5.  <s>Did you find interesting differences between regions in
    Brazil?</s>
6.  For your matching of the names vs streetname, how long did that join
    take? Any tips on making the join faster? (indexing ect? )(Keith H)
    Thanks!
7.  Did you disregard titles completely or also use them to determine
    gender? One can probably assume, that in catholic regions, all popes
    are male. -- das-g
    1.  Â No, there were some lonly female popes.
8.  Given names only don't need to be anonymous. They can be dedicated
    to one person. Needs research.
9.  Did you assess the quality of this method based on a subset with a
    source of known genders? (Like name:etymology:wikidata -&gt; sex or
    gender (P21) or similar)

10\. Is the peripheral link to females related to the streets being more
recent than the older central streets I wonder?

1.  1.  (Bernardo, since the stream ended): that could be a factor...
        But it could also be that the more "important names / people"
        were used for the more central and "more important" streets, and
        for smaller streets in the periphery there's more openesss to
        name it after a figure that is not "so historically important".
        But this is a hunch, needs further research!
        1.  Interesting - many thanks for an interesting talk. Lots to
            investigate !
            1.  You're welcome! Thanks for watching!
