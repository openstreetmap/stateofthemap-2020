1.  Thank you for your interesting talk: I read in another place that
    you, with RMSI, use AI-Road tracing in mapping projects in India. Is
    this something you want to include in the project with the helath
    care imports? And if yes, how could this work?
2.  You mentioned converting data to GEoJSON before being imported. Why
    that?
3.  How do you do the conflation with data that already exists in OSM,
    to make sure there are no doubles? How many health facilities were
    already on OSM? Do you also look at health facilities that are on
    OSM but missing from the official dataset, to see if they've been
    closed, etc.? (moved from below) Is all diff'ing (of the incoming
    gov data) manual or do you have tools?
4.  How clean/reliable/complete is the gov data?
5.  In NIN healthcare dataset I found ~1800 hospitals (district, sub and
    categorized according to bed size) whereas in OSM 33.5k (6/8/2020,
    amenity=hospital). Maybe you can elaborate on this discrepancy and
    challenges of matching the indian healthcare system scheme with osm
    tagging scheme.
    1.  (First thanks for your intersting talk, it is very valuable to
        me as I conduct some analysis on healthcare access in India.
        Sorry if I missed it in the beginning when you were clarifying
        sources for the import. I had a look into the NIN health
        facility dataset. )
6.  Could you please explain what is the exact meaning of
    healthcare=centre? Are there physicians/doctors in them? Were health
    facilities without doctors included in the import? And if yes how
    were they tagged? (There was a recent discussion on the tagging list
    which lead to an increased use of the recently created
    amenity=health\_post tag to cover such entities).
7.  Good to see that health facilities in India is improved,it will be
    good if all the rural areas are covered
8.  India is a huge country - how do you ensure you will find local
    contributors to validate and perform the import?
9.  You showed an example (JOSM screenshot) where healthcare=centre tag
    was added, but amenity=hospital was removed. Why was the amenity tag
    removed?
10. Have you collaborated with Healthsites (www.healthsites.io) at all?
    1.     ^^^^ to question author: Do Healthsites add data at all?
        Everytime I check things like phone nr, website etc are empty.
11. did u have special autorisation from the governement or Ministry of
    Health to include all data in osm ?
12. I'm working on the same project in my country and I'm adding one by
    one and it is more secure , what di u think ?
13. Great talk, thankyou :-)
14. Good to see that rmsi is improving the heatlth facilities in india
    :-)
