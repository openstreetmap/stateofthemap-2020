**Questions**

1.  \[Done\] Is the local tags analysis, done at the country level or
    what is the size of "regions" considered? -clairedelune
2.  \[Done\] Am I "local" when I map gas pipeline  i.e. 1/4 of France?
3.  \[Done\] It would be great to have access to data about localness -
    are you planning to release either the data, or your algorithms so
    that others can run them too? -- Frederik


**Comments**

1.  works for me+2. Thanks for letting us know. Many thanks video
    team!+2 :)
2.  Pascal Neis , Where did you contribute?:

3.  For mappers who start through HOTOSM their first change may be
    non-local, but you could look for \#missingmaps (or \#hotosm and
    other tasking manager tags) etc in the changeset comment to filter
    those out +2
    1.  I'd say that a great deal of mapping in the developing world is
        performed by mappers who are starting to map VERY far away from
        where they live. I'm a great example - that's exactly how I
        started. -Greg\_Rose
4.  I agree.  If you live in a well mapped place like London, you may
    not see any point in adding to OSM there, but when you travel to a
    relatively unmapped place you are much more likely to map
5.  Could we find a way to appreciate 'localness' as the best kind of
    collaboration between 'remote' and 'local' mappers that produces the
    best map that is usable to the local community for their use and
    practice (development | humanitarian etc). We are all local on Earth
    and what we do with our map/database is what counts. - Anni -

6.  As a local mapper, I'm paranoid one day someone/something will come
    along and delete all my hard work! All mappe
7.  Government boundries don't really match "effective" boundaries, but
    they are "official", so there is not much we can do. (Usually wrong
    50 meters.)
8.  In Taiwan some "hothead" "restored" all the arboriginal names, that
    nobody who lives there ever heard of. Gee thanks.
    1.  ---could we focus on developing skills for 'local' validators to
        reduce this from happening?
9.  Where are you going to do any case studies?  If you are interested
    in doing anything in Tanzania we at Crowd2map would be very
    interested in being involved!  Janet
10. Perhaps there are three categories: local, visitor, and remote (so
    'visitor' is mapping on the ground but doesn't have deep local
    knowledge)
11. I view my local area to be five km around my home.  Otherwise I
    would probably have to go to the area to get on the ground
    information.
12. Having worked with mappers from Lesotho, I can an amount of local
    knowledge by proxy, as they can explain what I am seeing from the
    satilite view. Tad
13. Yes it is true, mapping in an air-conditioned office works better
    than in the field with lightning strikes and wars, etc.
14. Don't tell anybody, but I even mapped all the electric meters. Their
    serial numbers are great location checks in a rural area. Of course
    the rendering snobs don't think so.
    1.  (They're also great for orienteering permanent check in markers
        :) - indiebio)
        1.  (I had to call them "street cabinets" Don't tell anyone.)
            1.  Great name! Seriously, is it a problem to map these
                (newb question)
                1.  It's because the city slicker tag committee thinks
                    they are like ants, not worth mapping.
                    1.  I think (especially) in developing countries
                        they are valuable as a location tool, and they
                        are valuable for recreational purposes like
                        orienteering (We don't have many forests in SA
                        so we make a plan for urban events)
