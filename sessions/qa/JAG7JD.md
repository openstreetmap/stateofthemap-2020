**Add questions here**


1.  What is the reason for the law --- is it connected with resisting
    Kurdish separatism (by taking control of mapped boundaries)?
2.  Do you think the government will try to exercise any control over
    non-Turkish contributors to OSM map data within Turkey?
3.  \[Anyone\] What are the best English-language sources (press,
    academic, etc.) to read about this?
4.  How can those of us outside Turkey support you?


**Comments**


1.  I had no idea about this - my symapthies to our Turkish colleagues
