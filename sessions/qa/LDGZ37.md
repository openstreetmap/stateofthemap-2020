-   \[ANSWERED\] What other software platforms are used besides OSM?
-   \[ANSWERED\] ODK Were there any issues with ODK?  And if so how have
    you overcome them?
    -   There were issues on how the form is built because it doesn't
        fit exactly with OSM tags.So we had to fix/make the form in a
        manner that will match the OSM tags.
-   Yes would love to know more about grant and what you have done etc..
    Janet
    -   So far we're still defining the details but we will be likely
        enabling a "translation" into "OSM" as a language that could be
        selected and translated into on export. allowing the CSV to be
        imported to JOSM for final edits or directly. I can talk to
        anyone with more details - Erica
-   \[ANSWERED\] So OSM must be much better than Google in Kenya by now,
    no? -jidanni/Taiwan
-   Next step: cadastral mapping! (Yes, there are OSM tags.)
    -jidanni/Taiwan
-   \[ANSWERED\] You produce fantastic maps.  How much training did
    people need to be able to create them? And is there any
    financial/budget information shown on any maps? I meant to create
    the maps in QGIS etc, how many people are involved in that?
    -   Our lead mapper Zack does that, and then I've been using Canvaa
        online to layout the maps after for print. (Erica)
-   How many times have you revisited Kibera for mapping over the years
    to keep the map up to date?
    -   We've been doing updates on our data just to ensure that the
        data is up to date since things keep on changing. Updates are
        usually done like twice or thrice a year. In other cases we do
        updates when consulted by an organisation to do some mapping for
        them. When we also have projects we do updates at the same time.
-   Lucy - you have been working with MapKibera since 2009! From your
    perspective, how have attitudes to OSM changed in Kenya since then?
    How have you got buy in with local government?
    -   i have seen the OSM community grow since the since as Mapkibera
        we;ve been able to transfer knowlege to different
        groups/institutions thus have a wider community of contributors
        on the OSM platfrom. As far as local gov't, we have built
        relationships with various officials in Nairobi when possible.
        In this project the World Bank had already created these
        relationships so we mainly followed their lead, although by
        getting to know them better we were more successful in some
        areas than others.
-   What if donors pull all their funds. Will / can the public continue
    mapping in a "hobby" fashion? Or are they not excited that much to
    continue?
    -   people are concerned to know what facilities they have or rather
        the distribution of these facilities so i think they will have
        to continue mapping regardless of wether funding is there ar
        not.


Comment: JOSM, with its different mouse binding (left vs. right) messed
up my "muscle memory". So I must use iD.

-   Quelles autres plateformes logicielles sont utilisées en plus d'OSM?
    -   ODK
-   Y a-t-il eu des problèmes avec ODK? Et si oui, comment les avez-vous
    surmontés?
-   L'OSM doit donc être bien meilleur que Google au Kenya, non?
    -jidanni / Taiwan
-   Prochaine étape: la cartographie cadastrale! (Oui, il existe des
    balises OSM.) -Jidanni / Taiwan
-   Vous produisez des cartes fantastiques. De combien de formation les
    gens avaient-ils besoin pour pouvoir les créer?
-   Et y a-t-il des informations financières / budgétaires sur des
    cartes?
-   Combien de fois avez-vous revu Kibera pour la cartographie au fil
    des ans pour maintenir la carte à jour?
-   Lucy - vous travaillez avec MapKibera depuis 2009! De votre point de
    vue, comment les attitudes envers l'OSM ont-elles changé au Kenya
    depuis lors? Comment avez-vous adhéré au gouvernement local?
-   Et si les donateurs retiraient tous leurs fonds. Le public
    pourra-t-il / pourra-t-il continuer à cartographier (de façon
    "hobby"?)
