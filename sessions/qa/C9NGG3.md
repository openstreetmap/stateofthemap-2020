        areas, or internet access methods)
3.  \[DONE\] Do you have over time data analysis as well? For example,
    if someone started in OSM via Grab, HOT etc, do they stay
    contributing after they leave one of those projects? - heather +1
    1.  this might be good data to get in the next stages
    2.  It would be great for you to write up the methodology on how
        others might be able to analyze the community health and growth
        in their countries? maybe an OSM diary - heather
4.  \[DONE\] What do you think motivates people to continue as
    contributor in OSM? -heather
5.  \[DONE\] What do you think is the impact of the "one map policy" in
    the work of OSM in the Indonesia archipelago?

**Comments**


-   really great to see a mix of quantitative and qualitative analysis
    using OSM tools and connecting communities  - heather
-   it would be nice to see all comunities doing this
-   This methodology is fantastic and can be built upon. Thanks to
    Pascal Neis for being an ally to help. the research also reminds me
    of Martin Dittus' work on HOT community. We do need to work with the
    CHAOSS community as they have set up research on community
    engagement and how to show the health. - recommend that Dwi reach
    out to them  - heather
