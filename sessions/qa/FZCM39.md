1.  (For Ian and Hanna) Is there any question you wished I asked you? -
    Gregory
2.  For Hanna, what kind of things are done by the board of directors.
    In Ireland we have just formed a company and could would like to
    hear your breakdown between practical work and project planning.
    1.  Thanks for the answer, is there working groups that take care of
        some of the practical tasks, or is it done by volunteers and not
        as defined.
3.  Koln map: well with so much on the map, I bet there are deletion
    wars? "Who took my trees off?" "I did. We don't need such junk
    cluttering the map."
4.  Koln map: So are all cell towers (secret in some countries) mapped
    yet?
    1.  And are they disguised as trees etc?
5.  So the government might even use OSM as a cadastral map basis? Or I
    guess they still have their more precise maps.


Comments:

-   Room wall echos. Volume levels sometimes dips.
    -   Yes, sorry I had limited places that I could be undisturbed. I
        should have gone outside like Ilya. - Gregory.
