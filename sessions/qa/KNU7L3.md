**Questions**


1.  \[DONE\] For knowing the risk of the building is to provide the
    exact location, the level etc of building, what about the road?
    1.  Could you be more specific please. Do you mean the risk of a
        road or the just the position of building on the road?
        1.  I meant the risk of road
2.  \[DONE\] The example of San Francisco is great but that was thanks
    to a data import project from Gov open data, what will happen in
    countries when the Governmemnts don't want to share this data to OSM
    because there might be corruption on the construction licenses they
    gave?
3.  \[DONE\] Does this research need DEM external data?
4.  \[DONE\] The lack of geological data on OSM and often among the
    opendata is a limit for the model? Would this type of data improve
    the model?


**Comments**


1.  In some "informal" cities, buildings didn't apply for permits and
    are in fact illegal, so any mapping of them is rather "sensitive."
2.  Realtors would not be happy to see your maps.
    1.  Certain classification info (estimations) we are internally
        calculating on a building level, we don't give them out
        publicly, but rather just work tightly with local authorities.
