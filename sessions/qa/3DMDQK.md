Add questions here

1.  what addressing standards were used to provide addresses and unique
    permanent codes for plotted buildings. Have you considered using
    Open Location Codes from Google?
2.  Is much data a government secret there?
3.  So 30k KM is \_proposed\_ fiber network, so how much fiber now?
4.  LSG=?
5.  (Thanks, very interesting presentation!) How did you find, recruit,
    and train 6,000 mappers? (for the first project you mentionned)
