6.  \[DONE\] Is it possible to go back to the community with members of

**Comments:**

1.   "entry in a specific jurisdiction felt impossible " Ha Ha Ha,
    sounds like a polite way to say they were chased out of town.
2.  Not using real collar clip etc. microphone.
    1.  So? The recording audio quality seems OK to me. -- das-g
        1.  Yes, now better.
3.  Yes the buildings don't have permits. So cannot legally exist,
    surely. So "please don't make them show up on the map."
4.  OK, fine. Can't map. Come back with a drone.
5.  Disguise as grandpa and grandma or some little kids.
6.  OK, don't let us map. Fine. No paving your roads or telephone line
    installation this year.
7.  You are creating open data, so tomorrow the city will be using it,
    just like the residents feared. So never mind saying you are a
    different group.
8.  I think doing participatory mapping, but with local people (not
    necessearily local leaders) may help. Additionally, I've found
    including local residents in decision-making (e.g. where can vs.
    can't map, what data points are collected) helpful.
9.  Yes showing up surveying means their land was sold, usually. So
    folks will fear.
10. Need town meeting and posters: XXX surveying project. July XX, 20YY.
11. Need big dinner party for the whole town. Prize draw.
12. Sounds like a one-day survey turned into a week-long PR effort,
    seven times more work.
