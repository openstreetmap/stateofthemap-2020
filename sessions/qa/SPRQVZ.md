**Add questions here**

1.  \[ANSWERED\] If mapper A maps a way, and corporate mapper B cuts the
    way in two, do you count those ways as created/last edited by A or
    B? - Guillaume Rischard
2.  \[ANSWERED\] HOT has done for-pay mapping, and has employed people,
    why did you not look at that?
3.  \[ANSWERED\] With the Grab/Singapore editing, are all those
    restrictions actually necessary? One common problem in the past is
    companies adding unneeded turn restriction relations e.g.
    no\_right\_turn into a no-entry oneway road. --Andy Allan
    1.  Almost all of them seem to be no\_u\_turn:
        <https://taginfo.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei/keys/restriction#values>
        which seems to be used for a continuous centerline on a road
        (counter-example:
        <https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/9041006> )
4.  \[ANSWERED\] Have you looked at size of mapping teams per company,
    and how that has changed? Rather than looking at edits per company.
    -- Gregory.
5.  \[ANSWERED\] How likely do you think it is that these hyper-niche
    mappers will stay around to map more things outside of their narrow
    interests? do you have any data that shows they have any rates of
    retention? --corey
    1.  thanks!
6.  \[ANSWERED\] Some corporate mappers are mapping part time for a
    company and also do volunteer mapping on their own. The changesets
    are generally differentiated by the presence of a changset hashtag
    if the mapper uses the same OSM user account. Do you account for
    this difference of mapping behavior? (Example: Kaart)  -- Eugene
7.  \[ANSWERED\] Do you think it's feasable to look at "displacement" of
    volunteer mappers? Questions like: does a heavily corporate-mapped
    area have a higher tendency to loose other mappers? Or do they shift
    their attention? Or does the (hopefully) increased data quality
    bring more people who are interested? -- Joost
8.  \[ANSWERED\] Anything you are willing to say about Google on the
    topic of corporate mapping? I know it might not be relevant. --
    Anonymous
9.  \[ANSWERED\] Do you have statistics/sources on where the
    corporations' paid mappers are based, geographically? --Tobias
    1.  Lyft had an OSM mapping office in Seattle, I'm not sure if it's
        still open.
10. \[ANSWERED\] What about outsourced mapping companies, like,
    GlobalLogic? -- Eugene
11. Question? – Name

-   Your globe looks really cool +3
-   HERE Maps hire data digitization companies to populate OSM for them,
    periodically importing this data into their own platform
-   There was also a map roulette challenge for tesla parking aisles


Boy I sure hope they use perfectly aligned imagery....
else
those
parking
lanes
will
end
up
down
here. -jidanni

-   Maybe they used gps traces instead of imagery.
    -   GPS bound to be even worse!!! Unless they got something better
        gear than we home mappers have.



-   All I know is with imagery +-5 meters offset, any such mapping will
    just do more damage than good.  OK, so they are certainly not using
    iD or cellphone GPS traces. OK, so ask them to share their secret
    tools. -jidanni
-   Great talk and so important to have this discussion. Looking to our
    own community - the challenge for us could be to strenghten mappers,
    editors and validators at all levels - 'remote' and 'local'. perhaps
    rather than lament the 'niche' mapping of corporations - lets take
    responsibility, do our bit and find ways to benefit from all the
    communities in OSM:)  Anni (rosymaps) +1
-   Nice to see someone is presenting the 3 years in a row :) --
    Anonymous :)+1
-   This research has so much potential! OSM should really get on board
    with these researchers. +3 +2 +1
-   Don't let <span class="underline">Google</span> put their address
    database on the map! Else all my friends will be sent to the wrong
    side of town. -jidanni P.S., you can't get a word in edgewise to
    Google.
-   OK, whatever view of WGS84 they are using will now become OSMs, due
    to their amount of edits. So expect everybody's "craft" edits will
    have to all move over to align with them. So I sure hope they are
    not misaligned. -jidanni
-   I'm saying all this corporate editing is great... if it is perfectly
    aligned.
-   Won't OSM end up with twos of things--- wouldn't it be faster for
    companies to just add a new (second) road, rather than check for an
    existing road, and edit or at least delete it first?
    -   response: then they would just make their own map? thats why OSM
        exists as a data b (shared)ase
