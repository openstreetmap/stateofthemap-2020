**Questions**


1.  How to explain it to 6 million users? OpenStreetMAP is not a map and
    the website where you see a map can not be used as any normal map.
    +1 (Only 6 million? Viewers too?)
    1.  How to keep them interested and excited to contribute more
        without a good and functional website?
2.  \[DONE\] How about Allan Mustard's views. And debate between you and
    him?
    1.  (note - I would love for a true debate on the versions of OSM
        the project and community. And, if we could add some
        voices/opinions from Asia, Africa, or South America, that would
        be great too.)
3.  The data seems outside of the point. Google Maps is a product, with
    definite end users identified and goals. We don't even have a
    consistent understanding of the users for the website. Isn't that
    what confuses people about OSM? How can we better communicate what
    OSM is about?
4.  \[DONE\] How much of your talk is OSM policy vs your personal
    opinion? +3
5.  \[DONE\] Has anyone ever seriously argued that OSM should include
    promotional blurb for businesses, like the dentist example you gave?
    1.  Answer (in Q&A session; paraphrased) "No, but I have deleted
        many"
    2.  \[DONE\] Why couldn't OSM also be a "business directory"?
        1.  users need to know where is the dentist, the grocery… when
            it is opened…
        2.  See the the success of Ça Reste Ouvert during the COVID-19
            crisis
        3.  Admit it, phone number tags mean you are more than just a
            map. (Good thing too.)
6.  \[DONE\] Why is there an 'us' and 'them' approach in how people use
    OSM? Whether is it is civic tech or humanitarian, surely there is
    just 'human' engagement with the project?
    1.  lol -- I think this question was referring to Frederik's
        perspective
7.  \[DONE\] Should the OSMF being working with press to counter-act
    these misconceptions or at least attempt to have as much press
    coverage as HOT? (+2)
8.  \[DONE\] Couldn't OSM as a whole attract just as much or more
    funding as the humanitarian groups do, except that OSMF has not
    wanted this funding?
9.  \[DONE\] Have you ever visited a mapping community in Africa? South
    America? Asia? +2-1
10. Why does this view of OSM - the project and the community not take
    into account the different approaches and contexts of local
    /regional mapping?
11. Hey wait a second. Who gets to say what OSM "is" and "isn't" any why
    define it "so fast" in the first place?
12. OK, you've got great ideas. But are you ever changed any since you
    joined OSM ever or are they the same from day 1?? ?
13. \[DONE\] Why did you go against the on the ground rule in Crimea?
    +2-1
14. Can you give a single example of an AI mapping proponent who has
    said that the community inputs are not important? Just one please.
    1.  <http://mike.teczno.com/notes/openstreetmap-at-a-crossroads.html> -
        "Left to the craft wing, OSM will slide into weekend irrelevance
        within 5-10 years" There you go.
        1.  +1-1
        2.  eh -- don't see the equivalence in those statements
            1.  (+1)
        3.  This statement clearly indicates that the “craft wing” is a
            sub-set of the community at large, so it’s not a good
            example of an AI mapping proponent saying that community
            inputs are not important.
            1.  "&lt;group&gt; will doom OSM" = "these people are
                unimportant" c'mon!
                1.  "&lt;group&gt; will doom OSM" is a misqoute; the
                    true quote is "&lt;group&gt; would doom OSM if
                    &lt;circumstace&gt; applied" - it was an arguement
                    against &lt;circumstace&gt;, not &lt;group&gt;
                    1.  "If we only have &lt;group&gt; things will get
                        really bad" = "&lt;group&gt; is not important"
                        1.  No, it is not; it is &lt;group B&gt; is also
                            requried"; consider: "if you only consume
                            water, you will die"
    2.  Facebook's first attempt of AI/CV import was done without
        telling anyone <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17856687>
        1.  4 years ago....
        2.  The question didn't have a time limit ;)
            1.  +2
            2.  Clever way to get around answering the real question
                1.  The question had explicit "just one" request
                    1.  Which you have failed to provide.
                        1.  This is like arguing with a biblical
                            fundamentalist about contradictions in the
                            bible! You can twist anything into anything.
                            :)
                            1.  I invoke *Arkell v. Pressdram*
                        2.  Let's reset: Is there evidence that the
                            proponents of AI based mapping are not
                            supportive of community mapping at present?
                            1.  The evidence has been provided. Are you
                                really trying to have a good faith,
                                genuine conversation? ;)
                                1.  No evdinece has been given, that
                                    satisfies the request "Can you give
                                    a single example of an AI mapping
                                    proponent who has said that the
                                    community inputs are not
                                    important?". HTH.
                            2.  Yes. Are there current examples. Not 4
                                year old ones
                                1.  That's a different question
                            3.  ↑ stop. This is a silly thread.
                                1.  I like levels
                                    1.  Me too
                                        1.  But this is getting
                                            1.  silly
                                2.  this guy needs to understand make
                                    research on how HOT has been very
                                    good to communities, African
                                    communities have grown cause of
                                    support from HOT
                                3.  I don't think he only references
                                    HOT. you are conflating
                                4.  how much research does Fredrick do??


Frederick can usually be found on IRC and is hosting a BBB "Virtual Pub
Meet" session tomorrow, you could chat to him there. We can also look
forward to him perha


**Comments**


1.  "openstreetmap.org is not aimed at the public (but at mappers)" Well
    the public can see it more and more all over the place... For every
    1 mappers that see it, there are 100regular people who see it when
    looking at e.g., government websites that have chosen it as their
    background.
2.  As I know:   instead of "we are not a map (but a database)"  We are
    an ecosystem ( community of mappers + database + developers +
    companies + AI algorithms )  .. in this priority orders ..  imho: 
    We need New Values !   and need a **New OSM Manifesto** !
    1.  +1
3.  "why the OSM community is often skeptical about filling an empty map
    with data imports, about AI contributions, or about automatic
    edits" - parts of the OSM community; please don't presume to speak
    for me.
4.  Sure, OSM on its own is NOT a "competitor of Google Maps"... and you
    outline the points clearly as to why it's not. However, OSM is a
    major and necessary part of (or perhaps powering?) a larger
    ecosystem of tools/data/products that together are a
    substitute/competitor/superior product to Google Maps for certain
    regions of the world and certainly for specific purposes (i.e.
    humanitarian applications or routing (in some areas)).
5.  There's no reason we can not show more than "control" of borders.
    It's just a tagging problem.
6.  Alas, local hothead OSM leaders define what is on the ground
    (language of place names in Taiwan).
7.  HOT does a lot of good work to train people on the ground so that
    they can make and maintain their own maps; the comments made in this
    presentation seem to be a gross misrepersenattion +1
    1.  Reply: yes, but not everyone working in humanitarian mapping
        does this, and it's a newer phenomenon for many. It's a fair
        point.
        1.  That wasn't the point the speaker made; he mis-described HOT
            as a whole, single, entity +1-1
            1.  Is HOT not a single entity?
                1.  not according to "not everyone working in
                    humanitarian mapping does this"
                2.  Everyone working in humanitarian mapping is not a
                    part of HOT...
                    1.  the original point - which you said was "fair" -
                        was about HOT.
                        1.   Oh by the speaker? I did not hear him speak
                            only re: HOT but outside of that it is a
                            fair point...As well even HOT has made a lot
                            of changes over the years.
                    2.  +1
8.  Pretty dismissive attitude towards humanitarian mapping. "Rich
    college kids"
    1.  +2
    2.  -1 (it was an example, don't have to take everything
        literally..imo)
        1.  1.  It was stated literally. but as an exampe, it would have
                been a dismissibve one.
    3.  +1-1
    4.  Yes very partronising  Rich countries giving maps to poorer
        ones??? +1-1
    5.  So you don't think that rich college kids do a lot of
        humanitarian mapping?
    6.  \#NotAllHumanitarianMappers: srsly? 🙄
9.  Fairly colonialist approach and tone about 'for africa rather than
    with 'communities'
    1.  I don't think that is what the speaker said, he was critiquing
        that approach. Or did I mis hear?
    2.  I don't think the speaker has a good idea of how HOT works and
        how OSM works outside of Germany
10.  The terms "ground" and "field" are often considered limiting in
    terms of power and equality.
11. Frederik’s “straw man voice” (the vocal inflection he uses when
    putting word in other people’s mouths) is a very ineffective
    rhetorical choice. I’m having trouble tracking which things are his
    opinions and which things are the opinions he ascribes to others.
12. There is no one way to OSM - there are many. The tone about
    'humanitarian mapping' and/or 'mapping in africa' misses that the
    way that people engage in the project and the community is diverse -
    thus a global community. The filter used here should not be
    considered "FACT" but a version. I hope that people can give space
    for other versions more.
    1.  "You are entitled to your own opinions - but not your own facts"
13. Yes, ever since Google started charging, lots of websites switched
    to OSM: Thus indeed a competetor to Google maps. -jidanni
14. Allan is not new to OSM. He has done his research.
    1.  +1
    2.  +1
15. we can map a path on a private backyard that we can not see from
    outside, but we can not map a shop without an outside sign?
16. Nice to catch the habit. Inclusive language is important. :-)
