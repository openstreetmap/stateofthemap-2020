This talk will describe what makes a city walkable, discuss the
experience of using OSM to measure walkability, and explore
possibilities for improving that measurement in the future.

1.  \[DONE\] How does elevation factor into the evaluation of
    walkability, as it can often reduce how far can be walked in a given
    time period?
2.  \[DONE\] How can I suggest a city to be added? – For example Berlin,
    Germany.
3.  \[DONE\] Have you talked to people who have used Pedestrian First to
    get feedback, do different parts of the world have different amounts
    of interest in finding walkability?
4.  Great project and very timely! When you think about/consider
    walkability do you also consider/take into account that in many
    parts of the world - streets & their sidewalks are also market
    places and not only as transit. Great to see you acknowledge it:)
    Thanks - Anni (rosymaps -chicago)
5.  \[DONE\] How many people are working on Pedestrians First? Are you
    working with other groups? - Gregory
6.  Have you thought of building a pedestrian-focused map layer?  In the
    same way there is opencyclemap, for example+1+1
    1.  Taylor: I haven't thought about this! I don't know what it would
        mean - email me! taylor.reich@itdp.org
    2.  Will do, but it's mostly a tile set which emphasizes pedestrian
        features rather than car features, <https://opencyclemap.org/>
7.  \[DONE\] Do you engage with local communities/mappers or rely soley
    on the OSM Data? There are many organised community groups e.g WIEGO
    who supports informal workers who spend a lot of their time on
    streets and could be a valuable partner to deepen the map in
    developing cities. Anni (rosymaps chicago)
8.  \[DONE\] Any thoughts on walkability and security: In a lot of
    African cities... maybe all cities aound the world, a lot of violent
    attacks occcur along pedestrian walks..making a lot of people in
    this cities to prefer other modes of transport.


Comments:

1.  Oh look, this store owner has cordoned off this typical Taiwan
    sidewalk: <https://goo.gl/maps/Hh45xQZyX3W4YXYc8> and even AI tools
    won't get the goverment to enforce the "laws" -jidanni
    1.  Often they even eat up one traffic lane too. So sidewalk eaten,
        and people + cars share the only remaining lane. So sure
        sidewalks exisit (underneath the buildings they put on top of
        them.)
2.  All that detail is great. But if **carto (the default OSM map
    style)** doesn't render it or allow zooming to it, "why should I map
    it?"
    1.  OSM is a database, there are many ways to render the data, not
        just carto. For example a smartphone app may be more appropriate
        to navigate and they consume tags not visible in carto.
        1.  Well Joe Public goes to OSM.org for his impression of "OSM".
3.  Placing items too close to roads gets them eaten in **<span
    class="underline">carto.</span>**
    1.  ahhh -- you mean, like people mapping sidewalks and sidewalk
        amenities? or are you talking about the data coming out of Peds
        First?
        1.  E,g,, tourist points of intrest. Too near a road: boom,
            eaten. GitHub issue response: well (in the west) things are
            never that close to roads. Electric poles also end up
            rendered "embedded" in roads they are on the side of (when
            we edit them).
        2.   That definitely sounds like a problem. We're not doing
            anything on the OSM data collection side - although we could
            be interested in some mapathon collaborations! - we just
            take the data from OSM and use it :)


<span class="underline">Questions from Taylor for the audience:</span>

1.  Can you imagine using Pedestrians First in your city? If so, how? In
    what role?
    1.  My city is already walkable and transport statistics show it as
        an important transport for work etc. Post-Covid19 there are
        changes to encourage further walking routes
    2.  Yes, I've been exploring something similar to look at how
        Liverpool (where I live) could become a "15 minute city". 
        That's bikes as well as walking, but mapping the amenities is
        something I want to add to it - <http://15minutecity.mcqn.com/>
    3.  Japanese cities tend to prioritize pedestrians more than before.
        (Nefore they didn't even have many sidewalks)
        1.  My city (Nishinomiya city) is functionally compact, and due
            to the effects of covid-19 I haven't boarded a car or train
            for three months.
2.  Do you have any suggestions for how we could improve Pedestrians
    First, either through OSM or other data sources, especially to
    measure street-level walkability?
    1.  Commonly available tags such as speed linit and lanes help
        calculate crossability for pedestrians+1
    2.  Further pedestrain tags perhaps that reflect details of how
        accessible a road or route is, we could use living streets or
        lighting to highlight safe streets for walking. Tags on road for
        pavements (side walks).+1
