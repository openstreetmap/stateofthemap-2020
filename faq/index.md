<h2 id="for-speakers">For Speakers and Session Hosts</h2>

<h3 id="talk-presented">How is my talk presented?</h3>
There will be an introduction session shortly before the conference for all speakers and session hosts. We will use the following workflow during your talk:
10 minutes before the talk the speaker and the session host test their equipment and connectivity with the video team.
The talk takes place in a Jitsi session which will be streamed publicly.
In the first 2-3 minutes the session hosts gives a short introduction about the speaker and the talk.
Then the pre-recorded video is broadcast.
During the broadcasting of the video the audience has the opportunity to ask questions on the Q&A pad of the talk.
After the video the session host and the speaker go through the questions of the talk. We have allocated about 20 minutes for that.


<h3 id="talk-qa">How can I participate it the Question & Answer session of my talk?</h3>
You have to join the Jitsi session of your talk and talk with the session host about the questions from the audience. You can watch all incoming questions in the Q&A pad (hackpad) linked in the detail page of your talk. It is the task of the session host to make a kind of pre-selection of the questions, sorting them and leaving out those that are inappropriate.


<h2 id="for-sponsors">For Sponsors</h2>

<h3 id="booths">How do sponsor booths work?</h3>
Platinum, gold and silver sponsors will have promoted channels on a BigBlueButton server. There is very good [documentation](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/overview.html) and [tutorial videos](https://bigbluebutton.org/html5/) available. 

<h3 id="booths">How do sponsors communicate their availability?</h3>
The sponsor maintain their section in the wiki at this URL: 

* [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2020/self-organized_sessions#Sponsor_Booths](
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2020/self-organized_sessions#Sponsor_Booths)

The [sponsors section of 2020.stateofthemap.org](https://2020.stateofthemap.org/#sponsors) will point to the corresponding Wiki heading of the sponsor. So that the sponsor can maintain content, URL, and schedules by themselves.
